# GlassHunt Challenge 5

http://challenges.glasshunt.co/challenges/5

A code simulation on how to execute the exploit on the 5th GLASS HUNT challenge.
For simplicity my sim is based on tests using [SafeMarket's Chaithereum](https://github.com/SafeMarket/chaithereum)

## Execution
Run `npm install` to download the dependencies and `grunt init` to deploy the contracts and run the test suite
